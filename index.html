    <article> <!-- COPIED FROM SKYMALL -->
      <p>Ah, we remember it like it was yesterday: Over a quarter century ago, on a 1989 buss ride home from high school, the idea for a unique retailer made accessible exclusively to school buss travelers was born. (These were the days before cell phones and air pods.) A year later, BusMall had arrived! Our first ever catalog was published and distributed to passengers on Sacramento City Unified School District Transportation Services, and a cultural institution (that’s us! If we do say so ourselves…) was created.</p>

      <p>Here at BusMall, we’re different. No, really! We continue to offer bus travelers the largest and most unique selection of interesting items, novelty gifts, and genius solutions to everyday problems. But we’re not afraid of growing with the times, too: Our full catalog (and then some!) joined the online shopping game and now we’re even better able to offer customers products and gadgets and tools and devices they once only dreamed of—not to mention more than a handful of items you never realized you needed until now.</p>
      
      <p>We’re proud to work with an awesome team of catalogers, manufacturers, and distributors who have helped us turn BusMall into what it’s become over the last 25+ years: a hub of ingenuity, imagination, and innovation. Come on in and take a look around at all we have to offer, both in the pages of our iconic in-transit catalog and here in our online store. We’re excited to be your go-to shopping destination for another quarter century and beyond!</p>
